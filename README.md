# Earthquake-Report-App

This is an android app which gives us information about the latest earthquake occured in the world.

This app also contains some filters to filter the earthquake you want to see.

In this app I used http connection to the USGS website to take latest earthquake information.

When you click on some earthquake in the app it redirects you to the official USGS page for the same earthquake you clicked on which contains more inormation abdout earthquake.
